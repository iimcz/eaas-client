# EaaS client JavaScript library

## How to use EaaS custom elements

1. Import eaas-client:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://emulation-as-a-service.gitlab.io/eaas-client/webcomponent.js"></script>
```

2. Include an `<eaas-environment>` element in your page:

```html
<eaas-environment id="example1"
  eaas-service="https://your-eaas-instance.example/emil/"
  environment-id="56a1936b-63f0-4c1d-9cbb-b0a813657a00"
  autoplay>
<strong>Please wait</strong> while the environment is being started ...
</eaas-environment>
```

By including the `autoplay` [boolean attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes#boolean_attributes), the environment will be started as soon as the page loads. Otherwise, you can have to start the environment yourself using JavaScript: `document.getElementById("example1").play()`.

In the element's content, you can include any placeholder elements of your own. They will be shown while EaaS is starting the environment, which might need some time.

## How to import the library for direct use from JavaScript

`import { Client } from "./eaas-client.js";`
